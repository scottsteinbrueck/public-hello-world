Public Hello World for practicing issues and PRs

Welcome to Scott's public hello world documentation.  Here we will practice creating issues and PRs for the purpose of being more fluent with the Github workflow.  These are the main steps we'll practice:
- Create issue with label(s)
-- Reply issue

- Create initial documentation
-- Update doc via PR and approvers
-- Approve PR and merge

Other topics we'll focus on:
- Automation via lables, milestones, projects, etc
- Adding GitHub applications to improve functionality, workflow, automation
- Tooling to make editing easier
- Tooling to make filtering and viewing issues easier.
